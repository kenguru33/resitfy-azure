# Microsoft Azure Active Directory Passport.js Plug-In
=============

_passport-azure-ad_ is a collection of [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) Strategies 
to help you integrate with Azure Active Directory. It includes OpenID Connect, 
WS-Federation, and SAML-P authentication and authorization. These providers let you 
integrate your Node app with Microsoft Azure AD so you can use its many features, 
including web single sign-on (WebSSO), Endpoint Protection with OAuth, and JWT token 
issuance and validation.

_passport-azure-ad_ has been tested to work with both [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) 
and with [Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services).

## 4. Installation

    $ npm install passport-azure-ad

## 5. Usage

This library contains two strategies: OIDCStrategy and BearerStrategy.

OIDCStrategy uses OpenID Connect protocol for web application login purposes. It works in the following manner:
If a user is not logged in, passport sends an authentication request to AAD (Azure Active Directory), and AAD prompts the user for his or her sign-in credentials. On successful authentication, depending on the flow you choose, web application will eventually get an id_token back either directly from the AAD authorization endpoint or by redeeming a code at the AAD token endpoint. Passport then validates the id_token and propagates the claims in id_token back to the verify callback, and let the framework finish the remaining authentication procedure. If the whole process is successful, passport adds the user information to `req.user` and passes it to the next middleware. In case of error, passport either sends back an unauthorized response or redirects the user to the page you specified (such as homepage or login page).

BearerStrategy uses Bearer Token protocol to protect web resource/api. It works in the following manner:
User sends a request to the protected web api which contains an access_token in either the authorization header or body. Passport extracts and validates the access_token, and propagates the claims in access_token to the verify callback and let the framework finish the remaining authentication procedure. On successful authentication, passport adds the user information to `req.user` and passes it to the next middleware, which is usually the business logic of the web resource/api. In case of error, passport sends back an unauthorized response.


We support AAD v1, v2 and B2C tenants for both strategies. Please check out section 7 for the samples. You can manage v1 tenants and register applications at https://manage.windowsazure.com. For v2 tenants and applications, you should go to https://apps.dev.microsoft.com. For B2C tenants, go to https://manage.windowsazure.com and click 'Manage B2C settings' to register applications and policies. 

### 5.1 OIDCStrategy

#### 5.1.1 Configure strategy and provide callback function

##### 5.1.1.1 Sample using the OIDCStrategy

```javascript
passport.use(new OIDCStrategy({
    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
    clientID: config.creds.clientID,
    responseType: config.creds.responseType,
    responseMode: config.creds.responseMode,
    redirectUrl: config.creds.redirectUrl,
    allowHttpForRedirectUrl: config.creds.allowHttpForRedirectUrl,
    clientSecret: config.creds.clientSecret,
    validateIssuer: config.creds.validateIssuer,
    isB2C: config.creds.isB2C,
    issuer: config.creds.issuer,
    passReqToCallback: config.creds.passReqToCallback,
    scope: config.creds.scope,
    loggingLevel: config.creds.loggingLevel,
    nonceLifetime: config.creds.nonceLifetime,
    clockSkew: config.creds.clockSkew,
  },
  function(iss, sub, profile, accessToken, refreshToken, done) {
    if (!profile.oid) {
      return done(new Error("No oid found"), null);
    }
    // asynchronous verification, for effect...
    process.nextTick(function () {
      findByOid(profile.oid, function(err, user) {
        if (err) {
          return done(err);
        }
        if (!user) {
          // "Auto-registration"
          users.push(profile);
          return done(null, profile);
        }
        return done(null, user);
      });
    });
  }
));
```

##### 5.1.1.2 Options

* `identityMetadata` (Required)

  The metadata endpoint provided by the Microsoft Identity Portal that provides the keys and other important information at runtime.    Examples:
  * v1 tenant-specific endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_name.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_guid/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v1 common endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v2 tenant-specific endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_name.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration 
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_guid/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v2 common endpoint
  ``` 
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  
  For B2C, you cannot use v2 common endpoint unless you specify the tenant in `passport.authenticate` using `tenantIdOrName` option. See section 5.1.3 for more details.
  
* `clientID` (Required)

  The client ID of your application in AAD (Azure Active Directory)
  
* `responseType` (Required)
  
  Must be 'code', 'code id_token', 'id_token code' or 'id_token'. For login only flows you can use 'id_token'; if you want access_token, use 'code', 'code id_token' or 'id_token code'.

* `responseMode` (Required)
  
  Must be 'query' or 'form_post'. This is how you get code or id_token back. 'form_post' is recommended for all scenarios.
  
* `redirectUrl`  (Required)
  
  Must be a https url string, unless you set `allowHttpForRedirectUrl` to true. This is the reply URL registered in AAD for your app. Production environment should always use https for `redirectUrl`.

* `passReqToCallback`  (Required)

  Whether you want to use `req` as the first parameter in the verify callback. See section 5.1.1.3 for more details.

* `allowHttpForRedirectUrl`  (Conditional) 
  
  Required to set to true if you want to use http url for redirectUrl like `http://localhost:3000`. 
 
* `clientSecret`  (Conditional)

  When `responseType` is not `id_token`, we have to provide client credential to redeem the authorization code. This credential could be client secret or client assertion. Non-B2C tenant supports both flows, but B2C tenant only supports client secret flow.
  
  For B2C tenant: `clientSecret` is required if the `responseType` is not 'id_token'.

  For non-B2C tenant: If `responseType` is not `id_token`, developer must provide either `clientSecret`, or `thumbprint` and `privatePEMKey`. We use `clientSecret` if it is provided; otherwise we use `thumbprint` and `privatePEMKey` for client assertion flow.

  `clientSecret` is the app key of your app in AAD. For B2C, the app key sometimes contains \, please replace \ with two \'s in the app key, otherwise \ will be treated as the beginning of an escaping character.

* `thumbprint`  (Conditional)

  Required if you want to use client assertion flow. `thumbprint` is the base64url format of the thumbprint (hash value) of the public key.

* `privatePEMKey`  (Conditional)

  Required if you want to use client assertion flow. `privatePEMKey` is the private pem key string.

* `isB2C`  (Conditional)

  Required to set to true if you are using B2C tenant.

* `validateIssuer`  (Conditional)
  
  Required to set to false if you don't want to validate issuer, default value is true. We validate the `iss` claim in id_token against user provided `issuer` values and the issuer value we get from tenant-specific endpoint. If you use common endpoint for `identityMetadata` and you want to validate issuer, then you have to either provide `issuer`, or provide the tenant for each login request using `tenantIdOrName` option in `passport.authenticate` (see section 5.1.3 for more details).
  
* `issuer`  (Conditional)
  
  This can be a string or an array of strings. See `validateIssuer` for the situation that requires `issuer`.

* `scope`  (Optional)

  List of scope values besides `openid` indicating the required scope of the access token for accessing the requested resource. For example, ['email', 'profile']. If you need refresh_token for v2 endpoint, then you have to include the 'offline_access' scope.

* `loggingLevel`  (Optional)

  Logging level. 'info', 'warn' or 'error'.
  
* `nonceLifetime`  (Optional)
  
  The lifetime of nonce in session in seconds. The default value is 3600 seconds.

* `clockSkew`  (Optional)

  This value is the clock skew (in seconds) allowed in token validation. It must be a positive integer. The default value is 300 seconds.
  
##### 5.1.1.3 Verify callback

If you set `passReqToCallback` option to false, you can use one of the following signatures for the verify callback

```
  function(iss, sub, profile, jwtClaims, access_token, refresh_token, params, done)
  function(iss, sub, profile, access_token, refresh_token, params, done)
  function(iss, sub, profile, access_token, refresh_token, done)
  function(iss, sub, profile, done)
  function(iss, sub, done)
  function(profile, done)
```

If you set `passReqToCallback` option to true, you can use one of the following signatures for the verify callback

```
  function(req, iss, sub, profile, jwtClaims, access_token, refresh_token, params, done)
  function(req, iss, sub, profile, access_token, refresh_token, params, done)
  function(req, iss, sub, profile, access_token, refresh_token, done)
  function(req, iss, sub, profile, done)
  function(req, iss, sub, done)
  function(req, profile, done)
```

#### 5.1.2 Use `passport.authenticate` to protect routes

To complete the sample, provide a route that corresponds to the path 
configuration parameter that is sent to the strategy:

```javascript

app.get('/login', 
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/' }),
  function(req, res) {
    log.info('Login was called in the Sample');
    res.redirect('/');
});

// POST /auth/openid/return
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the
//   home page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,
//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.
app.post('/auth/openid/return',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/' }),
  function(req, res) { 
    res.redirect('/');
  });

app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/');
});

```

#### 5.1.3 Options available for `passport.authenticate`

* `failureRedirect`: the url redirected to when the authentication fails

* `session`: if you don't want a persistent login session, you can use `session: false`. The default value is true.

* `customState`: if you want to use a custom state value instead of a random generated one

* `resourceURL`: if you need access_token for some resource. Note this option is only for v1 endpoint and `code`, `code id_token`, `id_token code` flow. For v2 endpoint, resource is considered as a scope, so it should be specified in the `scope` field when you create
the strategy.

* `tenantIdOrName`: if you want to specify the tenant to use for this request. You can use the tenant guid or tenant name (like 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'). Note: 
  * You must use common endpoint for `identityMetadata`, otherwise this option will be ignored. We will fetch and use the metadata from the tenant you specify for this request.
  * This option only applies to the login request, in other words, the request which is not supposed to contain code or id_token. Passport saves the `tenantIdOrName` value in session before sending the authentication request. When we receive a request containing code or id_token, we retrieve the saved `tenantIdOrName` value from session and use that value.
  * If you are using B2C common endpoint, then `tenantIdOrName` must be used for every login request.

* `domain_hint`: if you want to specify the domain that the user should use to sign in. This option is not supported for B2C tenant.

* `login_hint`: if you want to prefill the username with a given value in the login page. The value should be the `upn` of an user, not the email (most times they are the same though). 

* `prompt`: v1 and v2 endpoint support `login`, `consent` and `admin_conset`; B2C endpoint only supports `login`. 

Example:

```
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/', session: false, customState: 'my_state', resourceURL: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/mail.send'});
  
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { tenantIdOrName: 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' });
```

### 5.2 BearerStrategy

#### 5.2.1 Configure strategy and provide callback function

##### 5.2.1.1 Sample using the BearerStrategy

```javascript

// We pass these options in to the ODICBearerStrategy.

var options = {
  identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
  clientID: config.creds.clientID,
  validateIssuer: config.creds.validateIssuer,
  issuer: config.creds.issuer,
  passReqToCallback: config.creds.passReqToCallback,
  isB2C: config.creds.isB2C,
  policyName: config.creds.policyName,
  allowMultiAudiencesInToken: config.creds.allowMultiAudiencesInToken,
  audience: config.creds.audience,
  loggingLevel: config.creds.loggingLevel,
  clockSkew: config.creds.clockSkew,
};

var bearerStrategy = new BearerStrategy(options,
  function(token, done) {
    log.info('verifying the user');
    log.info(token, 'was the token retreived');
    findById(token.oid, function(err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return done(err);
      }
      if (!user) {
        // "Auto-registration"
        log.info('User was added automatically as they were new. Their oid is: ', token.oid);
        users.push(token);
        owner = token.oid;
        return done(null, token);
      }
      owner = token.oid;
      return done(null, user, token);
    });
  }
);
``` 

##### 5.2.1.2 Options

* `identityMetadata` (Required)

  The metadata endpoint provided by the Microsoft Identity Portal that provides the keys and other important information at runtime.    Examples:
  * v1 tenant-specific endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_name.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_guid/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v1 common endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v2 tenant-specific endpoint
  ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_name.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration 
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your_tenant_guid/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  * v2 common endpoint
  ``` 
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```
  
  For B2C, you can only use v2 tenant-specific endpoint.
  
* `clientID` (Required)

  The client ID of your application in AAD (Azure Active Directory)

* `passReqToCallback`  (Required)

  Whether you want to use `req` as the first parameter in the verify callback. See section 5.2.1.3 for more details.
  
* `isB2C`  (Conditional)

  Required to set to true if you are using B2C tenant.
  
* `policyName`  (Conditional)

  Required if you are using B2C tenant. It is a string starting with 'B2C_1_' (case insensitive).

* `validateIssuer`  (Conditional)
  
  Required to set to false if you don't want to validate issuer, default value is true. We validate the `iss` claim in id_token against user provided `issuer` values and the issuer value we get from tenant-specific endpoint. If you use common endpoint for `identityMetadata` and you want to validate issuer, then you must provide `issuer`.
  
* `issuer`  (Conditional)
  
  This can be a string or an array of strings. See `validateIssuer` for the situation that requires `issuer`.
  
* `allowMultiAudiencesInToken`  (Conditional)

  Required if you allow access_token whose `aud` claim contains multiple values.
  
* `audience`  (Optional)

  Must be a string or an array of strings. We invalidate the `aud` claim in access_token against `audience`. The default value for `audience` is `clientID`.
  
* `loggingLevel`  (Optional)

  Logging level. 'info', 'warn' or 'error'.

* `clockSkew`  (Optional)

  This value is the clock skew (in seconds) allowed in token validation. It must be a positive integer. The default value is 300 seconds.

##### 5.2.1.3 Verify callback

If you set `passReqToCallback` option to false, you can use the following verify callback

```
  function(token, done)
```

If you set `passReqToCallback` option to true, you can use the following verify callback

```
  function(req, token, done)
```

#### 5.2.2 Use `passport.authenticate` to protect resources or APIs

In the following example, we are using passport to protect '/api/tasks'. User sends a GET request to '/api/tasks' with access_token in authorization header or body. Passport validates the access_token, adds the related claims from access_token to `req.user`, and passes the request to listTasks middleware. The listTasks middleware can then read the user information in `req.user` and list all the tasks related to this user. Note that we do authentication every time, so we don't need to keep this user in session, and this can be achieved  by using `session: false` option.

```javascript
  server.get('/api/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }), listTasks);
```

#### 5.2.3 Options available for `passport.authenticate`

* `session`: if you don't want a persistent login session, you can use `session: false`. The default value is true.

Example:

```
  passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false });
```

## 6. Test

In the library root folder, type the following command to install the dependency packages:

```
    $ npm install
```

### 6.1. Run all tests except the end to end tests

Type the following command to run tests:

```
    $ npm test
```

### 6.2. Run all tests including the end to end tests

#### 6.2.1. Create test applications

First you need to register one application in v1 tenant, one in v2 tenant and one in B2C tenant. 

For the v2 application, you should register it at https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/ instead of Azure Portal.

For the B2C application, create four policies named 'B2C_1_signin', 'B2C_1_signup', 'B2C_1_updateprofile', 
'B2C_1_resetpassword'. For each policy, select 'Local Account' as the identity provider, and select the
following:

* 'B2C_1_signup': 

  * Sign-up attributes: 'Display Name', 'Email Address', 'Given Name', 'Surname'

  * Application claims: 'Display Name', Email Addresses', 'Given Name', 'Identity Provider', 'Surname', 'Users Object ID'

* 'B2C_1_updateprofile': 

  * Profile attributes: 'Display Name', 'Given Name', 'Surname'

  * Application claims: 'Display Name', Email Addresses', 'Given Name', 'Identity Provider', 'Surname', 'Users Object ID'

* 'B2C_1_signin': 

  * Application claims: 'Display Name', Email Addresses', 'Given Name', 'Identity Provider', 'Surname', 'Users Object ID'

* 'B2C_1_signin_acr': 

  * Application claims: 'Display Name', Email Addresses', 'Given Name', 'Identity Provider', 'Surname', 'Users Object ID'

  * After creating this policy, go the blade of this policy, click 'Edit' and then 'Token, session & SSO config'. Now switch the 'Claim representing policy ID' from 'tfp' to 'acr' and save the change.

* 'B2C_1_resetpassword': 

  * Application claims: 'Email Addresses', 'Given Name', 'Users Object ID'

You will also need to click the 'Run now' button in the 'B2C_1_signup' blade to create an user.

#### 6.2.2. Fill the test parameters 

Open `test/End_to_end_test/script.js`, set `is_test_parameters_completed` parameter to true. For `test_parameters` variable, fill in the tenant id/client id/client secret of your applications, and the username/password of your application user. The 'oid' value is the object id of your application user. To find the 'oid' value, go to your tenant, click 'Users and groups', find your user and click it. The Object ID value will show up in the new blade.

For `thumbprint` and `privatePEMKey` parameters, you need to specify a certificate for your app and register the public key in Azure Active Directory. `thumbprint` is the base64url format of the thumbprint of the public key, and `privatePEMKey` is the private pem key string. For a v1 tenant, you can follow [this post](http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/user-app-app-only-permissions-client-credentials-grant-flow-in-azure-ad-office-365-apis) to generate a certificate and register the public key. For a v2 tenant, you can go to your application page in the [v2 portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) and click `Generate New Key Pair`. A certificate will be generated for you to download. The corresponding public key is automatically registered in this case.  

#### 6.2.3. Run the tests

Type the following commands to run the tests:

```
    $ cd test/End_to_end_test/app
    $ npm install
    $ npm install grunt -g
    $ grunt run_tests_with_e2e
```

Tests will run automatically and in the terminal you can see how many tests are passing/failing. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad/blob/master/contributing.md).
